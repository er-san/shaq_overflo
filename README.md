###How We Did It

[Trello Account](TBD)

[Slack Discussion](TBD)

As a team, we chose to pick up the tasks that either interested us or challenged us. If any of us ran into difficulty, we usually paired off or collaborated as a group to figure out the best way to tackle the situation. As you can see above, we talked out user stories, schemas, and wireframes before working together on the migrations and models together.
